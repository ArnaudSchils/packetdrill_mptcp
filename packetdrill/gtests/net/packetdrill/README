Multipath tcp patch README:
---------------------------

New packetdrill features of this first commit:
    
    In local mode (no wire_server), both in ipv4 and ipv6 mode:
    - partial implementation of bind syscall allowing to specify a destination port.
    - multisocket support: it is possible to establish multiple tcp connections
    in a single packetdrill session (script). An implementation constraint is that
    mutliple tcp three way handshakes can't be interleaved in the script.
    - multipath tcp options implementation: mp_capable and mp_join "in both direction"
    (first syn sent by packetdrill - first syn sent by kernel).
    
Note that these extensions have not been tested in wire_server mode.
